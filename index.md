Welcome and hello! My name is Nicole. I am a third-year biomedical engineering student at Vanderbilt, but I have actually been working as a biomedical engineer here for the last ten years. I am also a first gen college student. My interdisciplinary research career has had a large focus on the gastrointestinal system. My effort is currently split between two incredible labs that have each brought me tremendous knowledge and incredible opportunities across completely diverse fields.

I have worked for [Alan Bradshaw](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tbee4G4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra) in the [Gastrointestinal SQUID Lab](https://www.vumc.org/biomag/welcome) for ten years. The SQUID Lab's focus is to develop noninvasive methods of diagnosing gastrointestinal diseases that would otherwise be hard to detect. Our overall goal is to add characterizing criteria to GI disorders by investigating gastric motility using electrical and magnetic field analyses. Each part of your gastric system functions at different frequencies - stomach 3 cycles per minute (cpm), intestine 10-12 cpm, colon 1-3 cpm. Our cutaneous 5x5 high density electrogastrogram (HR-EGG) array measures your electrical fields. Think heart EKG but for your stomach. The magnetogastrogram (MGG) measures the very weak GI magnetic fields using a highly-sensitive superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. Think tricorder from Star Trek, but it’s a tube fixed in the ceiling. We are currently running six clinical studies: EGG + MGG in pediatric chronic nausea in patients between seven and seventeen years old, EGG on neonates at risk of ischemia from congenital heart disease, measurement of fetal heart using MGG, two esophageal studies on achalasia with one involving E-POEM surgical intervention, and a G-POEM study on gastroparesis. 

The other half of my time has been spent working with [John Wikswo’s](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JnedIZ0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) program, the [Vanderbilt Institute for Integrative Biosystems Research and Education (VIIBRE)](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/viibre/), for the last eight years. With Wikswo, I have had the immense pleasure of working on a chemical and biological warfare defense grant for the last 7-8 years. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is one of the two top defense research agencies for the military. They pose tough problems with strict timelines and intense competition to achieve the best possible results. This project, [Rapid Threat Assessment](https://www.darpa.mil/program/rapid-threat-assessment), introduced me to the world of microfluidics, network analysis, and gut-on-a-chip while showing me the power of big data analyses and demonstrating the collective power of a tight-knit working group. Our patent for the high-throughput, multi-omic platform we developed to elucidate de novo mechanism of action of drugs and toxins in 30 days can be found [here](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/ad/64/a4/2d28627674621c/US10607721.pdf).
