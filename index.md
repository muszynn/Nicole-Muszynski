Welcome and hello! My name is Nicole. I am a biomedical engineer at Vanderbilt University. I am also a first gen college student. My interdisciplinary research career has had a large focus on the gastrointestinal system, with efforts currently split between two labs that have each brought me tremendous knowledge and incredible opportunities across completely diverse fields. I am an expert in measuring biomagnetic and bioelectric fields of the GI system utiizing Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) and cutaneous electrodes. I fathered the concept of the High-Resolution Electrogastrogram (HR-EGG). I also have experience in microfluidics, organ-on-a-chip, and organoid development from human tissue.

<p align="justify">
My skill set is unique in that I have the ability to develop clinical research studies working with patients and basic science experiments at the bench, both from conception to validation, giving me a breadth of experience in engineering, medicine, and systems biology. While my research skills might seem unfocused, my personal goals are very much structured with an overarching theme to incorporate both clinical and basic science while learning how to apply my engineering and computational skills to solve biological problems. I was also advised to use my graduate experience to embrace the Army’s strategic leadership challenges, with the overall goal of learning to think holistically about the programmatic scale and project aspect of the research and reflect that in the act of writing. Strategic leaders guide advancements not only by learning how to do the science, but by directing policy and strategy, acquiring and allocating resources, managing budgets and contracts, shaping external environments and seeking opportunities to advance organizational goals, and growing the next generation of leaders. I have been striving to encompass all of these.

I have wanted to study the gut-brain barrier since my first conference in 2013. I believe we won’t fully grasp the beauty and intricacies of gastrointestinal physiology until whole-organ study models start merging with cellular pathophysiology, analyzing function versus phenotype and creating new platforms amenable to multicellular environments that generate desired readouts depending on how cells are paired. The clinical studies in my thesis examine gastrointestinal motility disorders from the whole-organ perspective by studying humans and utilizing porcine subjects for computational models and validation experiments. Simultaneously, I developed the microfluidic experiments to understand how to study the effects of exogenous compounds, drugs, toxins, or pathogens, on single and multicellular environments. While the spiral mixer protocols were developed to understand millisecond signal transduction dynamics on single cells, I believe the next phase would be to incorporate enteroids for a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the intestinal epithelial surface upon exposure. Those experiments could then be correlated with longitudinal analysis from the multicellular 3D study models utilizing organ-on-a-chip or Transwells as the interface, depending on which cell types are of interest.

I have worked for [Alan Bradshaw](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tbee4G4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra) in the [Gastrointestinal SQUID Lab](https://www.vumc.org/biomag/welcome) in the Department of General Surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center since 2011. The SQUID Lab's focus is to develop noninvasive methods of diagnosing gastrointestinal diseases that would otherwise be hard to detect. Our overall goal is to add characterizing criteria to GI disorders by investigating gastric motility using electrical and magnetic field analyses. Each part of your gastric system functions at different frequencies - stomach 3 cycles per minute (cpm), intestine 10-12 cpm, colon 1-3 cpm. Our cutaneous 5x5 high density electrogastrogram (HR-EGG) array measures your electrical fields. Think heart EKG but for your stomach. The magnetogastrogram (MGG) measures the very weak GI magnetic fields using a highly-sensitive superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer. 

Vanderbilt’s GI research program utilizing Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) magnetometers started in 1994 with Dr. John Wikswo, Dr. Alan Bradshaw, and former chair of surgery, Dr. Bill Richards, where they reported the first human measurement of the intestine in 1996. I joined Bradshaw’s SQUID lab in 2011 as an intern, but by 2013 my role became lab manager, project manager, and research scientist. While my roles and responsibilities that lead to the lab’s successful publications look much different than doing basic science for Dr. John Wikswo, I am instrumental in making decisions that determine the successful design and outcome of studies across both research disciplines. In the SQUID lab, I am central to the application of electrogastrography (EGG) and magnetogastrography (MGG) to study GI propagation dynamics of electrical and magnetic activity. I am the father of the High Resolution Electrogastrogram array (HR-EGG), which we are currently utilizing across a half dozen clinical studies for adults, children, and neonates. 

In the SQUID lab, my focus and attention to small details while running big picture logistics are my superpowers. I have written and amended IRB protocols for human studies and IACUC protocols for animal studies. I have driven and passed audits for multiple agencies, including: IACUC, AAALAC, and NIH. I am responsible for successfully passing lab inspections from the USDA, AAALAC, and IACUC multiple times per year. I have successfully performed more than a dozen porcine surgeries as the primary surgeon. Responsibilities for animal studies include but are not limited to: ordering, overnight feeding, and fasting porcine subjects on a cost-effective timeline, booking the operating room, making sure all equipment is ready, calculating travel time from the OR to the lab such that IACUC protocols are followed exactly, giving anesthesia and monitoring breathing levels for the entirety of the experiment, cutting and suturing to avoid excessive blood loss, carrying out data collection and controlling variables, euthanizing and properly disposing of the subject post-operatively. I am the surgeon, the anesthesiologist, the scientist, and the project manager. The IRB studies involving human subjects bring an entirely new set of challenges. I am the patient interface from recruitment to the study’s close. The clinical experimental protocols and associated IRBs are consistently amended as new variables and ideas arise, just like they are at the bench. Because anxiety alters GI slow wave dynamics, one of my primary roles is to make sure the patients feel like they are in a safe environment. Since children are our primary study subjects, I have diligently worked to learn to communicate our science at a level they can comprehend. 

I am also responsible for maintaining our SQUID magnetometer. I drove the acquisition and installation of a custom cryocooler for our magnetometer, designed to capture and reliquify helium burnoff. This instrument, while quite nontrivial to install as it had never been done before, is the single defining reason we are able to run a variety of clinical studies simultaneously. Before the cryocooler, the SQUID took weeks to acquire materials and bring to temperature. I would single-handedly pull the five-foot magnetometer from the ceiling, fill with liquid nitrogen to drop temperature, blow out the liquid nitrogen, fill with liquid helium, and install back in the ceiling for studies. This maximum effort gave us approximately two weeks to collect data before the SQUIDs returned to room temperature. Due to our unbounded liquid helium usage, I was also instrumental in establishing the university’s current campus wide helium contract.

The other half of my time has been spent working with [John Wikswo’s](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JnedIZ0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) program, the [Vanderbilt Institute for Integrative Biosystems Research and Education (VIIBRE)](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/viibre/). My effort was divided equally between the SQUID lab and Dr. Richard Caprioli’s DARPA Rapid Threat Assessment project from 2014 to 2021. This project, [Rapid Threat Assessment](https://www.darpa.mil/program/rapid-threat-assessment), introduced me to the world of microfluidics, network analysis, and gut-on-a-chip while showing me the power of big data analyses and demonstrating the collective power of a tight-knit working group. Our patent for the high-throughput, multi-omic platform we developed to elucidate de novo mechanism of action of drugs and toxins in 30 days can be found [here](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/ad/64/a4/2d28627674621c/US10607721.pdf). Dr. Caprioli and Dr. Wikswo have been truly invaluably instrumental in training me to be a bench scientist and engineer, present science effectively, and accept feedback and criticisms without taking it personally. Our monthly meetings turned me into the scientist I am today. 

At the beginning of the RTA project, I audited Dr. Wikswo’s systems biology class that focused on the use of multi-omics for the determination of drug mechanism of action, and quickly became involved in a massive effort in which Wikswo, Melissa Farrow, James Pino, and I worked closely to expand the mechanism of action of cisplatin. This led to a very important paper of which I was a co-first author (Norris, Farrow, Gutierrez, Palmer, Muszynski, et al., “An integrated, high-throughput, multi-omics platform enables data-driven construction of cellular responses and reveals global drug mechanisms of action,” Journal of Proteome Research, 2017). I made key connections, identified a new resistance mechanism for cisplatin chemotherapy, and was central to the network synthesis effort. This effort led to the conception of MAGINE, a network analysis tool that enables multi-scale mechanism exploration in multi-omic datasets. While James Pino was the primary coder, I learned Python in order to turn computational concepts into a user-interface for systems biologists (Pino, Lubbock, Harris, Gutierrez, Farrow, Muszynski, et al. Processes in DNA Damage Response from a Whole-Cell Multi-Omics Perspective). Pino and I still use MAGINE for independent projects today. 

During RTA, we recognized that we could not achieve the required rapid processing of cells for proteomic and metabolomic analysis without improving our cell harvesting techniques. I immediately began experimenting with thermoforming slide dishes and a cold block for scraping cells from slides, which garnered twice as much protein collection, thus leading to identification of a commercial thermoforming company to mass produce the dishes I designed and tested. 

When we needed millisecond exposure of cells to drugs with precise metabolic cessation, I led Dr. Wikswo away from acoustic focusing to spiral mixers. Although acoustic focusing was a beautiful idea, the development of a prototype in our allotted time was not feasible. Instead of recreating the wheel, I took the known concepts of a spiral mixer, that rapidly dysregulates linear flow and applied it to cell intoxication. My spiral mixer approach provided us the mixing speed needed to meet a DARPA RTA deliverable.
